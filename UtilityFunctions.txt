split()       => String is converted into list of Strings
Example:
a = "this is a string"
a = a.split(" ") # a is converted to a list of strings. 
print a
['this', 'is', 'a', 'string']

join()          => The list of strings are joined
Example: Here the list of strings are joined with a '-' symbol
a = "-".join(a)
print a
this-is-a-string 

strip()                  => Used to remove the first letter of a word or sentence


map()
eg: x,k=map(int, input().split())
The variables are separated and the values are mapped to the respective variables.

eval()
The eval() is just like print() function where the eval() takes an input string computation formula and prints the output value.

zip()
The zip function is to iterate the values of string1 and string 2 one by one respectively.
This zip function is used in for loop

count()
To count how many repetitions has occured in the list or process in looping statements.
